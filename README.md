# NHS_Rota-to-ICS
A little script to take NHS rotas from DRS and convert them to .ICS files which can then be imported into a calendar program of your choosing.
It's not super robust as I only wrote it for personal use but if others can benefit then please make use of my work.

1. Go to https://www.realtimeusers.nhs.uk/UsersReports/ReportInp.aspx and log in with your details
2. Select "by individual" in the report options and set the timeframe to cover the rota portion you wish to export.
3. Select the correct name from the personnel (Doctor) drop-down.
4. Click Create PDF.
5. Modify line 20 in the cod to point to your recently downloaded file and hit run.
